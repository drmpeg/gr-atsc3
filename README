The goal of this project is to build a software-defined ATSC 3.0
transmitter, based on the A322 Physical Layer Protocol and A321
System Discovery and Signaling specifications.

The baseline implementation has been verified against the ATSC 3.0
validation and verification suite. The current implementation only
supports Transport Stream input.

A test flow graph is available in examples/vv031.grc. The parameters
match the ~15 dB S/N of ATSC 1.0 at 21.343539 Mbps. The test stream is
available here:

A Transport Stream bit-rate calculator is available here:

I'd like to thank Clayton Smith VE3IRR https://github.com/argilo for
his invaluable help with debugging, interpreting the specification and
calibration of the bootstrap resampler.

Features not implemented:

1) Frequency Division Multiplexing
2) Time and Frequency Division Multiplexing
3) Channel bonding
4) L1-Detail segmentation
5) L1-Detail additional parity
6) MISO
7) MIMO
8) ACE PAPR reduction
9) Low Level Signaling (LLS)
10) Baseband frame counter
11) Transmitter Identification (TxID)
12) IP packet input

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Contributions are welcome!
